                    I was born and raised in Southern California. I grew up in sunny Palm Springs California, which is know for its golf courses. After highschool, I moved to Las Vegas to pursue a passion in cooking. After 3 years there, I realized I wanted more for my life. I moved back from Nevada to California to go to school. After spending two years in college I left to figuer out what I  was interested in as I felt the traditional route of education and a job was not something I wanted. After a few years, I really started to get into computers and anything that has to do with it. I found I became really interested in coding and decided to take the leap and make it my career.
